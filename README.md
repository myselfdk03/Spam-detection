# Spam Detection Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning-based spam detection model implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The model is designed to classify messages as either spam or ham (not spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing text data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Transforming text data into numerical representations.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training and evaluating various classification models.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detection.git
   cd spam-detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run `spam-detection-model.ipynb` step by step.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled messages categorized as spam or ham. The data is preprocessed before feeding it into the model.

## Models Implemented
- **Na√Øve Bayes**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**

## Performance Metrics
The models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Usage
- Modify the dataset and retrain the model for better accuracy.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
- Extend the project to detect spam in different languages.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for improvements.
